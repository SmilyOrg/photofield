## [v0.21.0] - Search chips and wildcard date search

Happy New Year! 🥂

This release introduces interactive search chips for easier filtering and wildcard date patterns for recurring date searches.

### Added
* Improve search with search chips for easier filtering
  * Visual chips for common filters: date picker, similarity threshold slider, and image-based search
  * Supports "Date", "After", and "Before" chips for easier date range selection

* Wildcard date search patterns for recurring dates
  * Use `*` to match any year, month, or day component
  * Examples: `created:*-12-25` finds all Christmas photos, `created:2024-*-01` finds first day of every month in 2024
  
* Add "photos not found" message with tips on what could go wrong
  * Helpful diagnostics when collections appear empty, including suggestions about search filters, rescanning, and file system issues

* More streamlined release process
