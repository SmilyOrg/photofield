## [v0.18.0] - 2025-03-02 - Wider platform support and improved build process

There is no new functionality in this release, but the build and release process
has been refactored to use Taskfile and changie -- a nice learning experience.

The entire changelog has been extracted to CHANGELOG.md, which is now the
canonical source of release notes.

Releases are now built for many more platforms than before, let me know
if any of them come in handy or have issues :)
