# Quick Start

## Simple Executable

1. [Download and unpack a release] to a folder with folders of photos.
2. Run `./photofield` or double-click on `photofield.exe` to start the server.
3. Open http://localhost:8080 and you should see folders in the directory displayed as collections.
5. You're done ðŸ¥³

Check out [Usage](/usage) for more details.

[Download and unpack a release]: https://github.com/SmilyOrg/photofield/releases

## Docker

Make sure you create an empty `data` directory in the working directory and that
you put some photos in a `photos` directory.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v "$PWD/data:/app/data" -v "$PWD/photos:/app/photos:ro" ghcr.io/smilyorg/photofield
```

The cache database will be persisted to the `data` dir and the app should be
accessible at http://localhost:8080. It should show the `photos` collection by
default. For further configuration, create a `configuration.yaml` in the
`data` dir.

## Docker Compose
  
This example binds the usual Synology Moments photo directories and assumes
a certain path structure, modify to your needs graciously. It also assumes you
have configured the `/photo` and `/user` directories as collections in  `configuration.yaml`.
