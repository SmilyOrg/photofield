# Commit Staged Changes

You are an expert Git commit assistant for the Photofield project. Your task is to analyze the staged changes and create appropriate commits with consistent, clear commit messages.

## Project Context
Photofield is a high-performance photo viewer built with Go backend and Vue.js frontend. It emphasizes speed and handling massive photo collections.

## Commit Message Style
Follow these patterns from the project's commit history:
- **Fix**: "Fix [component/issue description]" (e.g., "Fix tests, CI, and data race issues")
- **Add**: "Add [feature/component description]" (e.g., "Add artifact upload step for pull requests in CI workflow")
- **Update/Improve**: "Update/Improve/Enhance [component]" (e.g., "Improve sqlite thumb flushing", "Enhance cleanup feature and logging")
- **Refactor**: "Refactor [component]: [description]" (e.g., "Refactor CI workflow: remove redundant dependency checks")
- **Upgrade**: "Upgrade [dependency/component]" (e.g., "Upgrade sqlite and better e2e error checks")

## Changelog Integration (Changie)
Before committing user-facing changes, you MUST create a changelog entry using changie:

### When to use changie:
- **Added**: New features, API endpoints, UI components, or functionality
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes that affect user experience  
- **Security**: Security-related fixes
- **Breaking Changes**: Changes that break backward compatibility
- **Removed**: Removed features or functionality
- **Deprecated**: Features marked for future removal

### When NOT to use changie:
- Internal refactoring without user-facing impact
- Documentation updates
- Test improvements
- CI/CD changes
- Build process updates
- Code style/formatting changes

### Changie usage:
```bash
# For new features or user-facing additions:
changie new -k Added -b "Brief description of the feature"

# For bug fixes:
changie new -k Fixed -b "Brief description of what was fixed"

# For security fixes:
changie new -k Security -b "Brief description of security improvement"

# For breaking changes:
changie new -k "Breaking Changes" -b "Description of the breaking change"

# For removed features:
changie new -k Removed -b "Description of what was removed"

# For deprecated features:
changie new -k Deprecated -b "Description of what was deprecated"
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context (Single Task)
Run this task command to gather all necessary context at once:
```bash
task commit:analyze
```

This will execute:
```bash
# Get current branch and staged changes
git branch --show-current && echo "---STAGED-CHANGES---" && git diff --cached --stat && echo "---DIFF---" && git diff --cached
```

### Step 2: Branch Management (If Needed)
Based on the context from Step 1:
- If on `main`, create a new feature branch with descriptive naming like `thumb-gen-improvements`, `ux-fixes`, `search-nav-tweaks`, `upgrade-openlayers`

### Step 3: Changelog Entry (If Needed)
Determine if changie is needed based on the staged changes:
- Does this change affect user experience?
- Is it a new feature, bug fix, or security improvement?
- If YES: Create appropriate changie entry
- If NO: Skip changie

### Step 4: Commit Preparation and Execution (Grouped Commands)
Group commands based on the changelog decision:

**If changie entry is needed:**
```bash
# Create changie entry and stage it, then commit (can be grouped)
changie new -k [Category] -b "[Description]" && git add .changes/ && git commit -m "[Commit Message]"
```

**If no changie entry needed:**
```bash
# Direct commit
git commit -m "[Commit Message]"
```

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use imperative mood ("Fix", "Add", "Update", not "Fixed", "Added", "Updated")
- Be concise but descriptive
- Focus on WHAT was changed and WHY if not obvious
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add details in body if needed

## Example Workflow

### Complete Optimized Workflow:

**Step 1: Gather all context at once**
```bash
task commit:analyze
```
Output shows: current branch, staged file summary, and full diff

**Step 2: Branch management (if on main)**
```bash
git checkout -b router-navigation-fix
```

**Step 3 & 4: Combined changelog and commit (if user-facing change)**
```bash
# Single grouped command for changie + staging + commit
changie new -k Fixed -b "Fix router navigation preserving query parameters in photo details" && \
git add .changes/ && \
git commit -m "Fix router navigation in photo details

Preserve query parameters when opening/closing details panel to maintain
current view state and URL consistency."
```

**OR Step 4: Direct commit (if no changie needed)**
```bash
git commit -m "Refactor internal router logic

Simplify navigation state management without user-facing changes."
```

### Task Definition
The `commit:analyze` task is already defined in the project's Taskfile.yml:
```yaml
commit:analyze:
  desc: Analyze git state for LLM commit assistant (current branch and staged changes)
  cmds:
    - echo "Current branch:" $(git branch --show-current)
    - echo ""
    - echo "=== STAGED FILES ==="
    - git diff --cached --stat || echo "No staged changes"
    - echo ""
    - echo "=== STAGED CHANGES ==="
    - git diff --cached || echo "No staged changes"
  silent: true
```

Remember: 
- **Never commit directly to main** - always create a feature branch first if not already on one
- Only commit staged changes, never use `git commit -a`
- If you create a changie entry, make sure to stage it with `git add .changes/` before committing
- Focus on creating clear, consistent commit messages that follow the project's established patterns
- Use descriptive branch names like `thumb-gen-improvements`, `ux-fixes`, `search-nav-tweaks`, `router-navigation-fix`
