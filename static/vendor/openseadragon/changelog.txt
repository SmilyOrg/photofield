1.0.0:

NOTE: This version has a number of breaking changes to the API, mostly in event handling. See below.

* BREAKING CHANGE: All EventSource and MouseTracker event handler method signatures changed to 'handlerMethod(event)' where event == { eventSource, userData, ... } (#251) (Also fixes #23, #224, #239)
    * The new eventSource property in the event object replaces the old eventSource parameter that was passed to handler methods.
    * Where the event object duplicated the eventSource value, those properties have been removed. This affects the following events:
        * All Button events - 'button' property removed
        * All Viewer (Viewer, Drawer, Viewport) events - 'viewer' property removed
* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed EventHandler to EventSource (#225)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Event names changed for consistency: changed to lower case, compound names hyphenated, and "on" prefixes removed (#226):
    * Viewer "animationstart" changed to "animation-start"
    * Viewer "animationfinish" changed to "animation-finish"
    * Button "onPress" changed to "press"
    * Button "onRelease" changed to "release"
    * Button "onClick" changed to "click"
    * Button "onEnter" changed to "enter"
    * Button "onExit" changed to "exit"
    * Button "onFocus" changed to "focus"
    * Button "onBlur" changed to "blur"
* BREAKING CHANGE: Numerous improvements to fullPage/fullScreen (#256):
    * Retains zoom/pan position better when switching into and out of fullPage.
    * Retains scroll position when switching back out.
    * More resilient to styling variations on the page.
    * setFullPage no longer automatically engages fullScreen; there's now a separate setFullScreen.
    * 'fullpage' event is now 'full-page'.
    * The `fullpage` property of the 'full-page' event is now `fullPage`.
    * There is now a 'full-screen' event with a `fullScreen` property (true if it has gone to full screen).
    * There are now 'pre-full-page' and 'pre-full-screen' events that include a `preventDefaultAction` property you can set in your handler to cancel. They also have `fullPage` and `fullScreen` properties respectively, to indicate if they are going into or out of the mode.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the 'onPageChange' callback from the viewer options. Viewer.goToPage() now raises the 'page' event only (#285)
* Major documentation improvements (#281)

    * Viewer.keyboardCommandArea.innerTracker.focusHandler: preventDefaultAction == true prevents scrolling viewer into view
    * Viewer.keyboardCommandArea.innerTracker.keyHandler: preventDefaultAction == true prevents viewer keyboard navigation
    * Viewer.innerTracker.clickHandler: preventDefaultAction == true prevents viewer zoom on click
    * Viewer.innerTracker.dragHandler: preventDefaultAction == true prevents viewer panning with mouse/touch
