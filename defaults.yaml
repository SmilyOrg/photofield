  # 
  # Media source configuration
  # 
  # Configures the different ways to load originals, photo variants,
  # thumbnails, transcoded images, etc. For each photo, during loading or
  # rendering, the most appropriate source is selected. The criteria include
  # desired and expected dimensions, expected loading time, and possibly others.
  # 
  # As a result, this configuration can have a large effect on the speed of
  # the application.
  # 
  # The following source types are supported:
  #   SQLITE, GOEXIF, THUMB, IMAGE, FFMPEG
  # 
  # Common properties include:
  # 
  #   type: Case-insensitive source type (see above)
  # 
  #   extensions: File extensions supported by this source - the source will be
  #               skipped during selection if unsupported
  # 
  #   width, height: Expected dimensions of the provided images. These can be
  #                  approximate in case it's not possible to know them upfront.
  #                  Used during source selection to decide which source to pick.
  #                  Some sources can have either hard-coded dimensions (e.g. sqlite)
  #                  or assume the dimensions of the source file instead (e.g. image).
  #
  #   fit: Aspect ratio fit of the provided image in case it doesn't match the
  #        original file. Not supported by all sources.
  #
  #     INSIDE
  #       The thumbnail size is the maximum size of each dimension, so in case
  #       of different aspect ratios, one dimension will always be smaller.
  #
  #     OUTSIDE
  #       The thumbnail size is the minimum size of each dimension, so in case
  #       of different aspect ratios, one dimension will always be bigger.
  #
  #     ORIGINAL
  #       The size of the thumbnail is equal the size of the original. Mostly
  #       useful for transcoded or differently encoded files.
  # 
  # 
  # Additional per-source properties are:
  # 
  # SQLITE - internal thumbnail database
  #   type: sqlite
  #   path: File path relative to the data dir of the sqlite database containing
  #         the thumbnails
  # 
  # GOEXIF - thumbnails embedded in JPEG EXIF metadata
  #   type: goexif
  # 
  # IMAGE - native image loading
  #   type: image
  #   width, height: Resize the image after loading (can be slow)
  #   extensions: Supported source file extensions
  # 
  # THUMB - pregenerated thumbnail files
  #   name: Short thumbnail type name
  #   path: Path template where to find the thumbnail
  #     {{.Dir}} is replaced by the parent directory of the original photo
  #     {{.Filename}} is replaced by the original photo filename
  # 
  # FFMPEG - transcoded images via FFmpeg
  #   width, height: Dimensions to which the source media should be resized
  #   fit: The aspect ratio fit to use while resizing
  #   path: Path to the FFmpeg binary, uses the one in PATH if not set
