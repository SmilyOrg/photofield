# Layouts

Photofield supports various layouts to display collections of photos. Each
layout offers a unique way to organize and view your photos.

You can set the default layout for each collection in the
[configuration](../configuration), or change the currently displayed layout
through the cog icon in the top right corner.

## Album

The **Album** layout groups photos chronologically by event. This layout is
ideal for organizing photos from different events or occasions.

## Timeline

The **Timeline** layout displays photos in a reverse-chronological order,
similar to Google Photos. This layout is useful for viewing recent photos first.

## Wall

The **Wall** layout creates a square collage of all the photos. This layout is
great for quickly browsing through a large number of photos.

## Map

The **Map** layout places all the photos on a map. This layout is perfect for
finding photos taken at specific locations.

## Flex

The **Flex** layout uses a variant of Knuth & Plass algorithm to create a
smarter layout, especially for photos with odd aspect ratios.

## Highlights

The **Highlights** layout varies the row height based on the "sameness" of the
photos. This layout is designed to make travel photo collections more skimmable
by shrinking similar and repeating photos. This layout requires AI to be enabled.
